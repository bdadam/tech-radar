// blipSize:
//  intValue; This is optional, if you omit this property, then your blip will be size 70.
//            This give you the ability to be able to indicate information by blip size too

//
// Coarse-grained quadrants
// - Techniques: elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such micro-services.
// - Tools: components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistance.
// - Platforms: things that we build software on top of: mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds
// - Programming Languages and Frameworks
//
// Rings:
// - Adopt: blips you should be using now; proven and mature for use
// - Trial: blips ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the adopt ring; use on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit
// - Assess: things that you should look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you
// - Hold: things that are getting attention in the industry, but not ready for use; sometimes they are not mature enough yet, sometimes they are irredeemably flawed
//      Note: there's no "avoid" ring, but throw things in the hold ring that people shouldn't use.

Examples would be change propagation for listings, static content and CQRS" },
            {"name": "Two-Factor auth. for everyone where possible", "pc": {"r": 83, "t": 122}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "As we are using public cloud services and managed services reachable from the Internet we consider a second factor during authentication as a must-have." },

We should excercise our disaster recovery strategy regularly and have game days with different kinds of disasters." },
            {"name": "Blue/Green Deployment", "pc": {"r": 55, "t": 105}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "The idea is to have two easily switchable environments to switch between. This makes it easy to rollback (fast) when something goes wrong. Dependent on your stack the implementation can vary. For CloudFormation you can use AutoCanary24." },
            {"name": "Continuous Delivery", "pc": {"r": 60, "t": 135}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "From continuousdelivery.com: 'Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.' This should be the default for every application. If Continuous Deployment (not only keeping your application in a state where it is always able to deploy into production but actually doing it) is applicable it should be used." },

            {"name": "Q.A. in Production", "pc": {"r": 30, "t": 120}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "With the rise of Continuous Delivery, the QA role is shifting to include analyzing software product quality in production. This involves monitoring of the production systems, coming up with alert conditions to detect urgent errors, determining ongoing quality issues and figuring out what measurements you can use in the production environment to make this work. This does not mean that pre-production QA is not needed anymore." },
            {"name": "Infrastructure as Code", "pc": {"r": 30, "t": 150}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "To avoid configuration drift and manual effort to scale or even update a system all infrastructure components should be version controlled." },

We try to use this also for the one container per host setup." },
            {"name": "CI Pipeline as Code", "pc": {"r": 150, "t": 123}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "We strive to keep logic out of the build pipeline and every deployment should be runnable from the developer's machine. But still there are manual steps required and changes in the pipeline are not tracked together with the source repository. Therefore we think it is a good option to put the pipeline configuration under version control, too." },
            {"name": "Docker as artifact", "pc": {"r": 150, "t": 135}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "Docker is offering many advantages like immutability, independence and portability. We want to profit from those, but without the burden of maintaining Docker clusters in the first hand. Therefore we currently see the Docker container mostly as a build artifact" },

            {"name": "Canary Releases", "pc": {"r": 150, "t": 172}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "The name for this technique originates from miners who would carry a canary in a cage down the coal mines. If toxic gases leaked into the mine, it would kill the canary before killing the miners. A canary release provides a similar form of early warning for potential problems before impacting your entire production infrastructure or user base. Compared to `Feature Toggles` or `BlueGreen Deployments` this is not a simple switch but more a slider. FeatureBee (Scala) as well as AutoCanary24 support Canary Releases. You can canary release toggled features with traffic distribution or you can canary deploy new service instances with traffic distribution or shadow traffic." },

This is convenient, as we have one place to define and see the whole pipeline. On the other hand are we limiting us to an agent based delivery. We could use one tools for CI that creates verified artifacts and use another specialized tool for delivery. This differentiation makes even more sense, when we look into container scheduler. For example Netflix uses Jenkins for CI and Spinnaker for delivery." },
            {"name": "Docker for Build Agents", "pc": {"r": 250, "t": 107}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "Sharing build servers with other pipelines is efficient but creates a dependency to the underlying software packages. We are all dependent on the Java, Ruby etc. installations on the agents. This can lead to time-consuming coordination and broken builds. Building software in Docker containers helps to get independent of the build agent and to avoid interferences between pipelines of different services." },

A way to achieve this is by monitoring the visual look of the page for changes." },
            {"name": "CQRS/Event Sourcing", "pc": {"r": 250, "t": 149}, "movement": "c", "url": "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-event-sourcing-cqrs", "explanation": "Command Query Responsibility Segregatin and Event Sourcing are no silver bullet. Immutable events stored in an append only fashion together with a read optimized query part make a good fit for microservices and for many use cases at AutoScout24. Don't be confused that many companies use different names for the some concepts." },

Since this was not sucessful there is now a new chance with HTML5 iFrames until web components can be adopted." },

            {"name": "Data Pump 'diversity'", "pc": {"r": 350, "t": 100}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "" },
            {"name": "Lockstep Releases", "pc": {"r": 350, "t": 120}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "Having to synchronize releases in the team or even between teams is painful and blocks the release of urgent bugfixes or other features. We should avoid that." },
            {"name": "CMS Boxes misuse", "pc": {"r": 350, "t": 140}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "CMS boxes are a common pattern for us. They provided a fast way to get different content on the web pages. As we are deploying more often today and have introduced UI composition to include content from different sources, we think that we should use CMS boxes for editorial content only. We should not use them for bringing advertisements or label texts on the pages." },
            {"name": "Feature Branches", "pc": {"r": 350, "t": 155}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "Feature branches isolate your work and defer continuous integration. The longer they exist the more it hurts to merge them back. Practices like Gitflow can support such a behaviour. When the only reason to start a new branch is the fear of continuous integration and therefore continuous deployment stop it." },
            {"name": "Custom Basic Authentication", "pc": {"r": 350, "t": 170}, "movement": "c", "url": "", "explanation": "While we are in our migration phase from the datacenter to the cloud not all platform services are available yet. To secure our APIs and administrative pages is hard without being able to use an identity service, therefore we have started to create workarounds by seting up custom basic authentication. We should strive to replace those solutions with proper OAuth2 implementations." }
